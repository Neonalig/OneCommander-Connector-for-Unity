## Installation

On Windows-based platforms, this plugin attempts to automatically detect the installation of OneCommander if not performed as a portable install. If you have installed OneCommander to a custom location, you can manually specify the path to the OneCommander executable in the [plugin settings](#plugin-settings).

This plugin has built-in support for versions 3.16.3+, and partial support for prior releases with varying levels of functionality. If you are using an older version of OneCommander, you may need to pick `Legacy` as the [app version](#app-version).

This plugin is compatible with Unity 2018.3 and above.

## Usage

Once [setup](#installation), you can use the [quick access buttons](#quick-access-buttons) and [context menu options](#context-menu-options) to quickly and easily view paths in OneCommander, or any other file manager, utilising extensive custom configuration options.

### Quick Access Buttons

Hover over any file or folder in the Project window, and you will see a set of quick access buttons appear in the top right corner of the asset. Clicking any of these buttons will open the path in OneCommander. As with all controls, hover over the buttons to see a tooltip with information about what each button does.
